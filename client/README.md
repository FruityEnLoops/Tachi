# Tachi Client

Tachi-Client is the frontend for Tachi.

## Setup

Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.

### CSS and Submodules

We legally cannot redistribute the source SCSS files for this repository, as they are from
[Metronic](https://preview.keenthemes.com/metronic8/demo2/index.html). Although the codebase itself has been completely cleanly implemented, with no metronic, the SCSS is still
theirs, and we do not have the legal right to redistribute it.

If you are a member of TNG-Dev, you will have access to [tachi-client-scss](https://github.com/tng-dev/tachi-client-scss). This submodule is located at `src/_assets/metronic-scss`.
Cloning this will make that the source of truth for CSS styling. Otherwise, we fall back
to `src/_assets/compiled-css/main.css`. This is legally redistributable compiled (minified)
output from the metronic SCSS.

## Dev Server

`pnpm start` launches a development server for rapid iteration. Use this if you're developing.

## Building

`pnpm build` compiles the source code into `build/`. This directory can then be shipped around and
served by tools like nginx. This should be used for production use cases only, as
compiling the client takes around 20-30 seconds, whereas the dev server is near instant.

## Config

For local development, use the `bootstrap.sh` script in `../_scripts` to set everything up.
